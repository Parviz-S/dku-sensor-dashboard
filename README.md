# DKU Sensor Dashboar

**Project description:**
Use IMU sensors to track the activity of the equipment in gym to gather data which would help us identify the rush hours, demand on the type of equipment and general insight on student activity at gym. Build a web application interface that manipulates and visualizes the data gathered from the sensors in real time.
